# MuseScore Backupper

Welcome to the MuseScore Backupper! This software backups your MuseScore Settings in case it corrupts. (which it sometimes does when messing around with the dpi settings.) 
This software has the aim of resolving those issues by restoring to a previous version of MuseScore.  It is currently written in batch.

# Support

Currently, there is only a development nightly version avaliable.

# Premium

This is licenced under the GNU Public Licence 3.0.   Everything is open source and free.  However, later in the development process, I will be adding a premium just
for some people to give their thanks. (no features behind paywall 100% gaurenteed)

# Current Known Issues

The archived backup fails when programme is installed to drives other than C:, the archiving fails.
